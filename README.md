# Interpreter-for-dotLang
dotLang is a simple programming language for the more or less meaningless task of moving a dot around in a 15*15 grid. This is mainly the last part of an interpreter for the language - the evaluator, so the syntax is closely related to the tokenization process and the creation of the abstract syntax tree.
